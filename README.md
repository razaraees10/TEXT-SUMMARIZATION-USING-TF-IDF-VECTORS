# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-USING-TF-IDF-VECTORS
This project utilizes natural language processing techniques to summarize text
documents efficiently. By implementing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency) vectors, the program scores sentences based on their
importance within the document.
The highest-scoring sentences are selected to generate a concise summary,
providing a quick overview of the document's key information.
